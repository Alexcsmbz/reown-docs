# Custom Networks

## Custom Networks addition and selection

AppKit already comes with a list of supported networks inside of `ReownAppKitModalNetworks` class. You can get supported EVM networks by selecting `ReownAppKitModalNetworks.supported['eip155']` and, currently, only EVM Networks are supported (non-EVM support will come soon)

You can also get supported test networks by doing `ReownAppKitModalNetworks.test['eip155']`.

Check the list of suppoted networks here https://github.com/reown-com/blockchain-api/blob/master/SUPPORTED_CHAINS.md#list-of-supported-chains

However, if these chains are not enough or you don't want to support any of them you can modify the list associated to the namespace.

:::info note
It is important that this is done before AppKitModal configuration.
:::

```javascript
// Example adding extra and test networks
final extraNetworks = ReownAppKitModalNetworks.extra['eip155'] ?? [];
ReownAppKitModalNetworks.addNetworks('eip155', extraNetworks);

final testNetworks = ReownAppKitModalNetworks.test['eip155'] ?? [];
ReownAppKitModalNetworks.addNetworks('eip155', testNetworks);

// Example removing Aurora network from the list
ReownAppKitModalNetworks.removeNetworks('eip155', ['1313161554']);
```

You can also create and add a custom network. For instance...

```javascript
final customNetwork = ReownAppKitModalNetworkInfo(
  name: 'Ethereum',
  chainId: '1',
  currency: 'ETH',
  rpcUrl: 'https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com',
  explorerUrl: 'https://etherscan.io',
  isTestNetwork: false,
);

ReownAppKitModalNetworks.addNetworks('eip155', [customNetwork]);
```
