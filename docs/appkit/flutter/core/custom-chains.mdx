# Custom Networks

## Custom Networks addition and selection

AppKit already comes with a list of supported networks inside of `ReownAppKitModalNetworks` class. You can get default supported EVM networks by selecting `ReownAppKitModalNetworks.supported['eip155']` and, currently, only EVM Networks are supported (non-EVM support will come soon). Check the list of [suppoted networks](https://github.com/reown-com/blockchain-api/blob/master/SUPPORTED_CHAINS.md#list-of-supported-chains)

This class also comes with extra networks `ReownAppKitModalNetworks.extra['eip155']` and test networks `ReownAppKitModalNetworks.test['eip155']`, however, these are not included in the supported list by default.

If these chains are not enough for you or you don't want to support some of them you can modify the list associated to the namespace.

:::info note
It is important that this is done before AppKitModal configuration.

### Adding extra and/or test networks to the supported list

```javascript
// Adding extra networks
final extraNetworks = ReownAppKitModalNetworks.extra['eip155'] ?? [];
ReownAppKitModalNetworks.addNetworks('eip155', extraNetworks);

// Adding test networks
final testNetworks = ReownAppKitModalNetworks.test['eip155'] ?? [];
ReownAppKitModalNetworks.addNetworks('eip155', testNetworks);
```

### Removing Aurora network from the list

```javascript
ReownAppKitModalNetworks.removeNetworks('eip155', ['1313161554']);
```

### Adding a custom network

```javascript
final customNetwork = ReownAppKitModalNetworkInfo(
  name: 'Ethereum',
  chainId: '1',
  currency: 'ETH',
  rpcUrl: 'https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com',
  explorerUrl: 'https://etherscan.io',
  isTestNetwork: false,
);

ReownAppKitModalNetworks.addNetworks('eip155', [customNetwork]);
```
