### SwiftPackageManager

You can add AppKit to your project with Swift Package Manager. In order to do that:

1. Open Xcode
2. Go to File -> Add Packages
3. Paste the repo GitHub url: https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift
4. Tap Add Package
5. Choose the AppKit products that you want installed in your app.

### Alternatively, add AppKit to a `Package.swift` manifest

To integrate via a `Package.swift` manifest instead of Xcode, you can add
AppKit to the dependencies array of your package:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(
    name: "AppKit",
    url: "https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift",
    .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")
  ),

  // Any other dependencies you have...
],
```

Then, in any target that depends on a AppKit product, add it to the `dependencies`
array of that target:

```swift
.target(
  name: "MyTargetName",
  dependencies: [
    // The product(s) you want (most likely AppKit).
    .product(name: "AppKit", package: "AppKit"),
  ]
),
```

<TabItem value="cocoapods" label="Cocoapods">

1. Update Cocoapods spec repos. Type in terminal `pod repo update`
2. Initialize Podfile if needed with `pod init`
3. Add pod to your Podfile like this:

```ruby
pod 'AppKit', '~> 1.0'
```

4. Install pods with `pod install`
   If you encounter any problems during package installation, you can specify the exact path to the repository

```ruby
pod 'AppKit', :git => 'https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift.git', :tag => '1.0.13'
```
