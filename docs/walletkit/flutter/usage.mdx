## Initialization

To create an instance of Web3Wallet, you need to pass in the `core` and `metadata` parameters.

```dart
final web3Wallet = await Web3Wallet.createInstance(
  projectId: '123.....',
  metadata: const PairingMetadata(
    name: 'Wallet Name',
    description: 'Wallet Description',
    url: 'https://your_wallet_url.com/',
    icons: [
      'https://your_wallet_icon.png'
    ],
    redirect: Redirect(
      native: 'yourwalletscheme://',
      universal: 'https://your_wallet_url.com',
    ),
  ),
);

```

## Session

A session is a connection between a dapp and a wallet. It is established when a user approves a session proposal from a dapp. A session is active until the user disconnects from the dapp or the session expires.

### Namespace Builder

On flutter you don't need to worry about Namespace Builder as Flutter SDK would handle that for you and generate a namespace object with the supported ones.

All you have to do is make sure you are registering

1. **events emitters** with `web3Wallet.registerEventEmitter()` for events you want to support on your wallet
2. **request handlers** with `web3Wallet.registerRequestHandler()` for methods you want to support on your wallet
3. **wallet's accounts** with `web3Wallet.registerAccount()` for accounts you want these events and methods to be enabled on

for every **chain** you want to support.

When a dApp propose a session, with declared required and/or optional namespaces, your wallet will be able to approve an **already generated set of namespaces** based on your registered events, methods and accounts.

You can access this object in **SessionProposalEvent** during `onSessionProposal` event by querying `event.params.generatedNamespaces`. (See next section)

However, if you decide not to use `web3Wallet.registerRequestHandler()` and, instead, you decide to handle session requests by subscribing to the `walletKit.onSessionRequest` events then all you have to do is construct your approved namespaces as follows:

```dart
final approvedNamespaces = {
  'eip155': const Namespace(
    accounts: [ // every account you want to support
      'eip155:1:0x76..........',
      'eip155:137:0x76..........',
    ],
    methods: [ // every method you want to support
      'personal_sign',
      'eth_sendTransaction',
    ],
    events: [ // every event you want to support
      'chainChanged',
      'accountsChanged',
    ],
  ),
};
```

Flutter SDK provides a handy `MethodsConstants` and `EventsConstants` for already defined set of required and optional values.

### EVM methods & events

In @walletconnect/ethereum-provider, (our abstracted EVM SDK for apps) we support by default the following Ethereum methods and events:

```ts
{
  //...
  methods: [
    "eth_accounts",
    "eth_requestAccounts",
    "eth_sendRawTransaction",
    "eth_sign",
    "eth_signTransaction",
    "eth_signTypedData",
    "eth_signTypedData_v3",
    "eth_signTypedData_v4",
    "eth_sendTransaction",
    "personal_sign",
    "wallet_switchEthereumChain",
    "wallet_addEthereumChain",
    "wallet_getPermissions",
    "wallet_requestPermissions",
    "wallet_registerOnboarding",
    "wallet_watchAsset",
    "wallet_scanQRCode",
    "wallet_sendCalls",
    "wallet_getCallsStatus",
    "wallet_showCallsStatus",
    "wallet_getCapabilities",
  ],
  events: [
    "chainChanged",
    "accountsChanged",
    "message",
    "disconnect",
    "connect",
  ]
}
```

### Session Approval

As mentioned before, the `SessionProposalEvent` is emitted when a dapp initiates a new session with your wallet. The event object will include the information about the dapp and requested namespaces. The wallet should display a prompt for the user to approve or reject the session.

To approve a session, call `approveSession()` and pass in the `event.id` and your approved namespaces.

- If you decide to use the `registerRequestHandler()` method to register handlers for supported methods, as explained in previous section, you would use the `generatedNamespaces` object in the `approveSession`
- If you decide to handle session requests by subscribing to the `onSessionRequest` event, you would need to pass your own set of approved namespaces.

Either way you decide you would subscribe to the `onSessionProposal` event and use `approveSession()` as follows:

```dart
walletKit.onSessionProposal.subscribe((SessionProposalEvent? event) {
  // display a prompt for the user to approve or reject the session
  // ....
  // If approved
  web3Wallet.approveSession(
    id: event.id,
    namespaces: // event.params.generatedNamespaces! or approvedNamespaces,
  );
});
```

#### Pairing

The `pair` method initiates a WalletConnect pairing process with a dapp using the given `uri` (QR code from the dapps). To learn more about pairing, checkout out the [docs](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/pairing/).

Scan the QR code and parse the URI, and pair with the dapp.  
Upon the first pairing, you will immediately receive `onSessionProposal` and `onAuthRequest` events.

```dart
Uri uri = Uri.parse(scannedUriString);
await web3Wallet.pair(uri: uri);
```

### Session Rejection

To reject the request, pass in an error code and reason. They can be found [here](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/error-codes).

To reject a session:

```dart
walletKit.onSessionProposal.subscribe((SessionProposalEvent? event) {
  // display a prompt for the user to approve or reject the session
  // ....
  // If rejected
  web3Wallet.rejectSession(
    id: event.id,
    reason: Errors.getSdkError(Errors.USER_REJECTED),
  );
});
```

### Responding to Session requests

To handle a session request, such as `personal_sign`, you have two ways and they are mutually exclusive, so, you use either one way or the other:

1. The default one is subscribing to onSessionRequest events and handle the request based on the method that is firing the event

```dart
walletKit.onSessionRequest.subscribe(_onSessionRequest);

void _onSessionRequest(SessionRequestEvent? event) async {
  if (event != null) {
    final id = event.id;
    final topic = event.topic;
    final method = event.method;
    final chainId = event.chainId;
    final params = event.params as List;

    // message should arrive encoded
    final decoded = hex.decode(params.first.substring(2));
    final message = utf8.decode(decoded);

    // display a prompt for the user to approve or reject the request
    // if approved
    if (approved) {
      // Your code to sign the message here
      final signature = ...

      return web3Wallet.respondSessionRequest(
        topic: topic,
        response: JsonRpcResponse(
          id: id,
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          result: signature,
        ),
      );
    }
    // if rejected
    return web3Wallet.respondSessionRequest(
      topic: topic,
      response: JsonRpcResponse(
        id: id,
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        error: const JsonRpcError(code: 5001, message: 'User rejected method'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

2. The second way is to register a request handler for the methods and chains you want to support. So let's say your wallet supports `eip155:1` and `eip155:137`. This would translate to:

```dart
final supportedChains = ['eip155:1', 'eip155:137'];
Map<String, dynamic Function(String, dynamic)> supportedMethods = {
  'personal_sign': _personalSignHandler,
  'eth_sendTransaction': _ethSendTransactionHandler,
};
for (var chainId in supportedChains) {
  for (var method in supportedMethods.entries) {
    web3Wallet.registerRequestHandler(
      chainId: chainId,
      method: method.key,
      handler: method.value,
    );
  }
}

Future<void> _personalSignHandler(String topic, dynamic params) async {
  final id = web3Wallet.pendingRequests.getAll().first;

  // message should arrive encoded
  final decoded = hex.decode(params.first.substring(2));
  final message = utf8.decode(decoded);

  // display a prompt for the user to approve or reject the request
  // if approved
  if (approved) {
    // Your code to sign the message here
    final signature = ...

    return web3Wallet.respondSessionRequest(
      topic: topic,
      response: JsonRpcResponse(
        id: id,
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        result: signature,
      ),
    );
  }
  // if rejected
  return web3Wallet.respondSessionRequest(
    topic: topic,
    response: JsonRpcResponse(
      id: id,
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      error: const JsonRpcError(code: 5001, message: 'User rejected method'),
    ),
  );
}

Future<void> _ethSendTransactionHandler(String topic, dynamic params) async {
  // ...
}
```

Once you have your handlers registered, this are going to be triggered **INSTEAD OF** the `onSessionRequest` event.

The main difference between these 2 ways of handling session requests is that the default one, using `onSessionRequest` events, carry more useful information such as the **request id** and the **chain id** which are not carried when using the request handlers registration.

### Updating a Session

If you wish to include new accounts or chains or methods in an existing session, `updateSession` allows you to do so.
You need pass in the `topic` and a new `Namespaces` object that contains all of the existing namespaces as well as the new data you wish to include.

After you update the session, the dapp connected to your wallet will receive a `SessionUpdate` event.

```dart
await web3Wallet.updateSession(topic: 'topic', namespaces: '{}')
```

### Extending a Session

To extend the session, call the `extendSession` method and pass in the new `topic`. The `SessionUpdate` event will be emitted from the wallet.

```dart
await web3Wallet.extendSession(topic: 'topic')
```

### Session Disconnect

To initiate a session disconnect, call the `disconnectSession` method and pass in the `topic` and a `reason`.

When either the dapp or the wallet disconnects from a session, a `SessionDelete` event will be emitted. It's important to subscribe to this event so you could keep your state up-to-date.

```dart
await web3Wallet.disconnectSession(
  topic: session.topic,
  reason: Errors.getSdkError(Errors.USER_DISCONNECTED),
);
```

Using `disconnectSession()` alone will make the pairing topic persist, i.e, it can be re-used until it expires. If you want to disconnect (remove) the pairing topic as well you would have add another call as follows:

```dart
await web3Wallet.core.pairing.disconnect(
  topic: pairing.topic,
);
```

#### Supporting session events

In order to support session events, such as `chainChanged` or `accountChanged`, you would have to to register an event emitter for such events, for every chain you want to emit an event for (similar to request handlers).

```dart
final supportedChains = ['eip155:1', 'eip155:137'];
const supportedEvents = ['chainChanged', 'accountChanged'];
for (var chainId in supportedChains) {
  for (var event in supportedEvents) {
    _web3Wallet.registerEventEmitter(
      chainId: chainId,
      event: event,
    );
  }
}
```

And to emit an event, call `emitSessionEvent()` as follows:

```dart
await web3wallet.emitSessionEvent(
  topic: session.topic,
  chainId: 'eip155:1',
  event: SessionEventParams(
    name: 'chainChanged',
    data: 1,
  ),
);
```
